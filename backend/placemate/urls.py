"""
Root URL Configuration for the HireSphereX Project.

This is the main URL dispatcher for the entire application. 
Its primary role is to act as the main entry point for all incoming web traffic and delegate requests
to the appropriate application-level URL configurations.

It defines the paths for:
- The Django Admin interface.
- The versioned application API (under /api/v1/).
- System health checks.
- API documentation.
