    Renders an HTML template with a given context and sends it as an email.

    This is the primary, centralized email-sending function for the entire application. 
    It dynamically uses the email backend configured in the active settings file.

    Args:
        subject (str): The subject line of the email.
        template_name (str): The path to the email template, relative to the 'templates' directory
        context (dict): A dictionary of data to be rendered into the template.
        recipient_list (list): A list of recipient email addresses.

    Raises:
        Exception: Will raise an exception (e.g., SMTPServerDisconnected) if the
                   email backend fails to send the email, because `fail_silently` is set to False.
